Product Vision

Team Name: Umbreon

Team Members: Hardy Lewis, Lucas Rector, Alan Huff, Oliver Perrin

Here, you will want to document the outcome of a “product vision” discussion with your team. I know we aren’t actually creating something to sell, but try to be creative about who could use it and why they would want it – this will help when you are coming up with a specific list of features later.

First, complete the template below:

FOR target customer:  A game to be used by children and young adults
WHO want to pass time and explore a simple 2d adventure landscape.
THE game Pathfinder’s Odyssey is a 2D Top Down, Action Adventure Simulation
THAT has graphics and world manipulation reminiscent of early 2d graphic games.
UNLIKE Cool Math Games type games that rely on an internet connection,
OUR PRODUCT provides a space focused on fun offline gameplay.

Second, feel free to add any further thoughts/details below:
Pathfinder's Odyssey addresses the need for a captivating 2D adventure game that delivers on the desires for immersive exploration, compelling narratives, visually pleasing graphics, and memorable audio experiences.

Details here. You don’t need to add anything here, but anything you add could be helpful later.
